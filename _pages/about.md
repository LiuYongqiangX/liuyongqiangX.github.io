I'm a third year PhD student from Beijing Jiaotong University. My research interest includes Integrated navigation system and Visual Re-localization.

I am very fortunate to be supervised by Prof. Wang Jian of Railway Satellite Navigation Lab from BJTU. Now, I am currently a collaborative PhD student under the guidance of Prof. Battisti in the Department of Information Engineering at the University of Padua.
